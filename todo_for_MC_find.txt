Todo: Detect the Main Character animations for each direction without needing hundreds of sprite sheets

Todo: Organize bot into state action of the game
* Loading game screen
* Thylacine logo screen
* Controller pad screen
* TItle screen
* Save select screen
* Castle screen
* Realm screen (for each realm)s


Idea: Use floor tiles to find area that have an object on that tile (it won't match)

Todo for tomorrow
Attach metadata to assets
* Realm quest?
* realm they are in
* item type (altar, breakable, plant, etc)

Todo
Figure out how to track enemies
Maybe track the grid of my creatures, and search for any areas around that have a gap + detecting an object that could be creature?
